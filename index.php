		<p> 
			After I started to learn C++, I developed an interest in programming languages, 
			going as far as to dive straight into the deep end with C++ and JavaScript. Although I 
			enjoyed doing so, I decided it would be more productive to start with something more basic.<br><br>
			As a result, I now enjoy working with HTML & CSS and I am getting involved with PHP to
			enrich my web development experience but I want to learn more!

		<p>
			I enjoy building/upgrading and generally just plain fiddling with Computers and I will 
			take any excuse to try and get inside a PC case. I learnt to work with computers when I was
			young, finally building my own from scratch when I was 18.<br>
			Quite often friends and family will ask me for advice or help fixing their computers and laptops 
			whether it might be upgrading or buying a new one (or on the odd occasion, for help when their 
			cat turns their screen upside down!).
