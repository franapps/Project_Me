	<h2>So Whats Next?</h2>
	<p> First and foremost, this lovely site of mine (yes, it's not wonderfully beautiful but I'm proud it anyway)
		is by no means done. There are at least a couple of features that I can think of off-hand that I want to add to
		the site, like an email form on the contact page so people can send me quick messages. I also want to update the site's
		appearance, however this is not one of my highest proirities so it probably won't be for a few weeks yet. Basicly, 
		I'm happy for the site to be up, but it's still a work in progress. <br><br>So if I'm not working on the site, what am I doing? Learning new things!
		Currently I'm learning Python from a couple of books, "Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python" by Al
		Sweigart and "Programming Python", O'Rielly 4th Edition. The latter book I came across first, it was
		quite widely recommended across the internet so I got myself a copy and delved into it, however I found
		that it was not the most 'new programmer' friendly book, as it was aimed at experienced programmers
		looking to sharpen their skills, and I while I was working my way through, I felt that I was missing some 
		fundamental concepts; this is where the Al Sweigart book came in useful, as it was aimed at brand new programmers 
		and was written in a way as to assume the reader had no previous experience, as an added bonus it was written 
		from a games perspective which, as an avid gamer myself, has made the content enjoyable and I am learning
		the language quite happily.<br><br> On the side, I am also working on another website which I am not going to mention
		just yet but keep your eye out in the next couple of weeks to see what I've been working on!</p>

	<h2>My First Project: This website!</h2>
	<p>It took me some time to settle on a concept for the site that I was happy with. The original idea
		was to convert my CV into a webpage, however whilst designing the layout and the content of the 
		site, I realised that all my information would be publicly available, and I didn't really want to 
		'bare all' about myself to the internet. So drawing inspiration from a few other sites, I opted 
		for a simpler design, where I could describe who I am to anyone who wants to know in a few simple 
		words and create a contact page. <br>Et Voila! My webpage was born!<br> Initially, there were two variants
		to this particular design, the one you are looking at now and "the darker one" as I came to call it. The
		latter was a fully coloured webpage in a <span class="beige">beige</span> color similar to the 
		colour used on my front page in the character bubbles. Whilst not a particularly dark coloured theme, the 
		page felt much darker in tone in comparison to the current whitespace version. It also felt more difficult
		to read the text as there wasn't really a colour that I was happy with that really stood out against the 
		background for the text so in the end, I opted for the current version. However I will say that the other scheme had a 
		much warmer feel to it (mostly due to the colour), it also felt more wholesome and comfortable as the colour
		encompassed the entire page so that there was no cold, dead whitespace to be seen.</p>
